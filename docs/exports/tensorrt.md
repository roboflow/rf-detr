# TensorRT Export

If you want lower latency on NVIDIA GPUs, you can convert the exported ONNX model to a TensorRT engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Run TensorRT conversion on the same machine and GPU family where you plan to deploy inference.

## Prerequisites

- Install the TensorRT extra: `pip install rfdetr[tensorrt]` (provides `tensorrt`, `polygraphy`, `onnx`, and `onnxconverter-common`; the latter two cast the ONNX graph to FP16 on TensorRT 11+; no `trtexec` binary needed)
- A CUDA GPU (the engine is built for the local GPU architecture)
- Export an ONNX model first (for example: `output/inference_model.onnx`)

## Export Directly to TensorRT

Pass `format="tensorrt"` to `export()` to export ONNX and convert to a TensorRT engine in one step:

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRMedium

model = RFDETRMedium(pretrain_weights="<path/to/checkpoint.pth>")

model.export(format="tensorrt")
```

This exports `output/inference_model.onnx` first and then produces `output/inference_model_fp16.trt` (the `_fp16`/`_fp32` suffix always reflects the precision actually built — see `fp16` in [Export Parameters](advanced.md#export-parameters) — unless `output_name` is set).

!!! note "Dynamic batch"

    Pass `dynamic_batch=True` together with `max_batch_size` to build one engine that accepts any batch from 1 to `max_batch_size`. The engine gets a single TensorRT optimization profile with `min=1`, `opt=batch_size` and `max=max_batch_size`, so `batch_size` should be the batch you serve most often; other sizes inside the range run, TensorRT just tunes its kernels for `opt`. Without `dynamic_batch` the engine accepts only the batch size baked into the intermediate ONNX graph.

    ```python
    model.export(format="tensorrt", dynamic_batch=True, batch_size=4, max_batch_size=16)
    ```

    **Why a single profile with `min=1`, not several.** The engine always builds with one TensorRT optimization profile spanning the full `1 .. max_batch_size` range, rather than several narrower profiles picked at runtime with `set_optimization_profile_async`. This is a deliberate trade-off, not a limitation: it keeps the export API and the runtime simple (one engine, one profile, no profile-selection logic in the caller), and the measured cost at the tuned `opt` batch is small (see the [changelog](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for per-GPU numbers). A deployment that never serves batches below some floor — for example a DeepStream or Triton pipeline always fed a fixed batch of frames (see [#376](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr/issues/376)) — pays for optimizing kernels down to batch 1 even though it never uses them, foreclosing per-batch-band multi-profile support (`set_optimization_profile_async` plus several `Profile()` entries), which is TensorRT's own standard mitigation for the away-from-opt penalty. A `min_batch_size` (paired with `max_batch_size`) or a list of `opt_batch_sizes` each with its own profile may become configurable in a future release if a narrow-band deployment need arises; today, export one profile spanning the batches you plan to serve.

!!! note "Who consumes the `.trt` engine?"

    The `.trt` engine produced by `format="tensorrt"` is a standalone artifact for raw TensorRT deployment. It is locked to the GPU architecture and TensorRT version of the machine that built it, so it is not portable across different GPUs or TensorRT releases.

    If you plan to run inference with [`inference-models`](basics.md#run-inference-with-inference-models) (the recommended path), do **not** pass `format="tensorrt"` — `inference-models` builds and manages its own TensorRT engine internally and does not consume this file. Export a plain ONNX model instead and let `inference-models` handle the backend.

## Engine Description File

A `.trt` file has no slot for user metadata, so a consumer that does not import the model, such as a C++ service, [Triton](https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server) or [DeepStream](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk), cannot learn what the engine expects from the file itself. Pass `trt_metadata=True` to write `<engine>.json` next to it, with the same name and a `.json` suffix:

```python
import hashlib
import json
from pathlib import Path

engine = model.export(format="tensorrt", trt_metadata=True)
# engine -> output/rfdetr-medium_fp16.trt, described by output/rfdetr-medium_fp16.json

with open(Path(engine).with_suffix(".json")) as description_file:
    description = json.load(description_file)
engine_bytes = Path(engine).read_bytes()  # deserialize these bytes, not a second read of the file
if hashlib.sha256(engine_bytes).hexdigest() != description["engine"]["sha256"]:
    raise RuntimeError(f"{engine} is not the engine this description was written for")
height, width = description["input"]["height"], description["input"]["width"]
```

| `engine`         | The engine file this description was written for: its `size` in bytes and `sha256`, the SHA-256 hex digest of its bytes. Compare them with the `.trt` you load, as in the example above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `input`          | The input tensor: `name`, `layout` (`NCHW`), `dtype`, `height`, `width`, `channels`, `channel_order` (`"RGB"` for three channels, otherwise `null`), `normalization` and `resize`. Pixel values are divided by `normalization.scale`, then `(x - mean) / std` is applied per channel; `resize` is bilinear with half-pixel centers and no antialiasing, and its `aspect_ratio` is `"stretch"`: the whole image is resized to `height` x `width`, with no letterbox and no padding, so the boxes are normalized to the image and scale by its original width and height. |
| `outputs`        | The output tensors in the order the engine returns them, each with `name` and `dtype`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `batch`          | `{"dynamic": false, "size": N}` for a static engine, or `{"dynamic": true, "min": 1, "opt": N, "max": M}` for one built with `dynamic_batch=True`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `build`          | How the engine was built: `precision` (the one actually built, which can differ from `fp16` on a lean TensorRT wheel), `opset`, `tensorrt_version` and `gpu` (`name` and `compute_capability`, or `null` when PyTorch has no CUDA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `notes`          | The `notes` passed to `export()`: a string as it is, any other value JSON-encoded into a string (decode it once more), or `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

All inputs and outputs are `float32`, also for an `fp16` engine. The normalization values are the ones `RFDETR.predict()` applies.

!!! note "What the file does not say"

    It does not record class names or which logit slot is the background class. How a slot maps to a class depends on the checkpoint (official COCO weights use sparse COCO category ids, fine-tuned models use contiguous ids), and `RFDETR.predict()` decides it internally. For `dets` and `labels` outputs, `dets` holds normalized `cx, cy, w, h` boxes and `labels` holds raw class logits, which `RFDETR.predict()` turns into scores with a per-class sigmoid (not a softmax) before it keeps the highest-scoring (query, class) pairs above the confidence threshold; see [`decode_detections`](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr/blob/main/src/rfdetr/export/_runtime/decode.py) for how the repository turns them into detections.

The file is written after the engine and replaces an older one of the same name in one step, so a reader never sees half a file. On Linux and macOS it gets the engine's permission bits and, where you are allowed to set it, the engine's group, so a service that can read the engine can read the description too. Only `RFDETR.export` (or calling the exporter on a prepared graph) writes it; `TensorRTExporter.build_engine` on an `.onnx` file has no graph to describe and does not, and with `TensorRTConfig(metadata=True)` it warns that the setting has no effect there. If the file can't be written, `export()` raises `OSError` after the engine is built, and the message says so.

The engine and its description are still two files, replaced one after the other. A program that reads them while an export is running, or after two exports of the same name ran at the same time, can find an engine next to the description of another build. That is what `engine` is for: compare its `sha256` with the bytes you load, as the example above does, before you trust the rest.

The engine's file name doesn't include its batch profile or input size, so a later export of the same model overwrites the engine and can leave an old `.json` next to it. When a build doesn't write a description (`export()` without `trt_metadata=True`, or `build_engine`) and one with the engine's name is already there, you get a warning that it may no longer match. The file is never deleted, because this build didn't write it; a program that checks its `engine.sha256` finds out whether it still matches.

## Python API Conversion

Use this only to convert an **already-exported** `.onnx` file without re-running the model export. To go straight from a checkpoint to an engine, use [`format="tensorrt"`](#export-directly-to-tensorrt) above.

!!! warning "Internal API"

    `rfdetr.export._tensorrt.exporter` is a private module — the leading underscore means it carries no stability guarantee and may move or change signature in any release. `RFDETR.export(format="tensorrt")` is the supported entry point; use the class below only when you need to convert an already-exported `.onnx` file.

```python
from rfdetr.export._tensorrt.exporter import TensorRTConfig, TensorRTExporter

exporter = TensorRTExporter(TensorRTConfig(fp16=True))
engine_path = exporter.build_engine("output/inference_model.onnx")
# -> "output/inference_model_fp16.trt"
```

`TensorRTExporter.build_engine` builds the engine in-process via the TensorRT Python API (no `trtexec` subprocess) and returns the path to the generated `.trt` engine file. Precision and progress logging come from the `TensorRTConfig` the exporter is constructed with — pass `TensorRTConfig(output_name="my-engine")` to write `output/my-engine.trt` verbatim instead.

An `.onnx` file exported with `dynamic_batch=True` needs `dynamic_batch=True` here as well, plus `max_batch_size`, the largest batch the engine accepts. `opt_batch_size` (default `1`) is the batch its kernels are tuned for. Without `dynamic_batch=True`, `build_engine` raises `ValueError` rather than building an engine that accepts batch 1 only.

```python
exporter = TensorRTExporter(TensorRTConfig(fp16=True, dynamic_batch=True, max_batch_size=16, opt_batch_size=4))
engine_path = exporter.build_engine("output/inference_model.onnx")
```
