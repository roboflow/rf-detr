# Train an RF-DETR Model

You can train an RF-DETR model on a custom dataset using the `rfdetr` Python package, or in the cloud using Roboflow.

Training on device is ideal if you want to manage your training pipeline and have a GPU available for training.

Training in the Roboflow Cloud is ideal if you want managed training whose weights you can deploy on your own hardware and with a hosted API.

For this guide, we will train a model using the `rfdetr` Python package.

Once you have trained a model with this guide, see our [deploy an RF-DETR model guide](/learn/deploy/) to learn how to run inference with your model.

### Dataset structure

RF-DETR expects the dataset to be in COCO format. Divide your dataset into three subdirectories: `train`, `valid`, and `test`. Each subdirectory should contain its own `_annotations.coco.json` file that holds the annotations for that particular split, along with the corresponding image files. Below is an example of the directory structure:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── _annotations.coco.json
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ... (other image files)
├── valid/
│   ├── _annotations.coco.json
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ... (other image files)
└── test/
    ├── _annotations.coco.json
    ├── image1.jpg
    ├── image2.jpg
    └── ... (other image files)
```

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/annotate) allows you to create object detection datasets from scratch or convert existing datasets from formats like YOLO, and then export them in COCO JSON format for training. You can also explore [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/) to find pre-labeled datasets for a range of use cases.

### Fine-tuning

You can fine-tune RF-DETR from pre-trained COCO checkpoints. By default, the RF-DETR-B checkpoint will be used. To get started quickly, please refer to our fine-tuning Google Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-finetune-rf-detr-on-detection-dataset.ipynb).

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRV3Base

# Uses DINOv3 Base encoder by default
model = RFDETRV3Base()

model.train(
    dataset_dir=<DATASET_PATH>,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=4,
    grad_accum_steps=4,
    lr=1e-4,
    output_dir=<OUTPUT_PATH>
)
```

To use the original DINOv2 backbone instead, import `RFDETRBase`.

Different GPUs have different VRAM capacities, so adjust batch_size and grad_accum_steps to maintain a total batch size of 16. For example, on a powerful GPU like the A100, use `batch_size=16` and `grad_accum_steps=1`; on smaller GPUs like the T4, use `batch_size=4` and `grad_accum_steps=4`. This gradient accumulation strategy helps train effectively even with limited memory.

### Result checkpoints

During training, multiple model checkpoints are saved to the output directory:

- `checkpoint.pth` – the most recent checkpoint, saved at the end of the latest epoch.

- `checkpoint_<number>.pth` – periodic checkpoints saved every N epochs (default is every 10).

- `checkpoint_best_ema.pth` – best checkpoint based on validation score, using the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) weights. EMA weights are a smoothed version of the model’s parameters across training steps, often yielding better generalization.

- `checkpoint_best_regular.pth` – best checkpoint based on validation score, using the raw (non-EMA) model weights.

- `checkpoint_best_total.pth` – final checkpoint selected for inference and benchmarking. It contains only the model weights (no optimizer state or scheduler) and is chosen as the better of the EMA and non-EMA models based on validation performance.

??? note "Checkpoint file sizes"

    Checkpoint sizes vary based on what they contain:

    - **Training checkpoints** (e.g. `checkpoint.pth`, `checkpoint_<number>.pth`) include model weights, optimizer state, scheduler state, and training metadata. Use these to resume training.
    
    - **Evaluation checkpoints** (e.g. `checkpoint_best_ema.pth`, `checkpoint_best_regular.pth`) store only the model weights — either EMA or raw — and are used to track the best-performing models. These may come from different epochs depending on which version achieved the highest validation score.
    
    - **Stripped checkpoint** (e.g. `checkpoint_best_total.pth`) contains only the final model weights and is optimized for inference and deployment.

### Resume training

You can resume training from a previously saved checkpoint by passing the path to the `checkpoint.pth` file using the `resume` argument. This is useful when training is interrupted or you want to continue fine-tuning an already partially trained model. The training loop will automatically load the weights and optimizer state from the provided checkpoint file.

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRBase

model = RFDETRBase()

model.train(
    dataset_dir=<DATASET_PATH>,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=4,
    grad_accum_steps=4,
    lr=1e-4,
    output_dir=<OUTPUT_PATH>,
    resume=<CHECKPOINT_PATH>
)
```

### Early stopping

Early stopping monitors validation mAP and halts training if improvements remain below a threshold for a set number of epochs. This can reduce wasted computation once the model converges. Additional parameters—such as `early_stopping_patience`, `early_stopping_min_delta`, and `early_stopping_use_ema`—let you fine-tune the stopping behavior.

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRBase

model = RFDETRBase()

model.train(
    dataset_dir=<DATASET_PATH>,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=4
    grad_accum_steps=4,
    lr=1e-4,
    output_dir=<OUTPUT_PATH>,
    early_stopping=True
)
```

### Multi-GPU training

You can fine-tune RF-DETR on multiple GPUs using PyTorch’s Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). Create a `main.py` script that initializes your model and calls `.train()` as usual than run it in terminal.

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py
```

Replace `8` in the `--nproc_per_node argument` with the number of GPUs you want to use. This approach creates one training process per GPU and splits the workload automatically. Note that your effective batch size is multiplied by the number of GPUs, so you may need to adjust your `batch_size` and `grad_accum_steps` to maintain the same overall batch size.

### Logging with TensorBoard

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) is a powerful toolkit that helps you visualize and track training metrics. With TensorBoard set up, you can train your model and keep an eye on the logs to monitor performance, compare experiments, and optimize model training. To enable logging, simply pass `tensorboard=True` when training the model.

<details>
<summary>Using TensorBoard with RF-DETR</summary>

<br>

- TensorBoard logging requires additional packages. Install them with:

    ```bash
    pip install "rfdetr[metrics]"
    ```
  
- To activate logging, pass the extra parameter `tensorboard=True` to `.train()`:

    ```python
    from rfdetr import RFDETRBase
    
    model = RFDETRBase()
    
    model.train(
        dataset_dir=<DATASET_PATH>,
        epochs=10,
        batch_size=4,
        grad_accum_steps=4,
        lr=1e-4,
        output_dir=<OUTPUT_PATH>,
        tensorboard=True
    )
    ```

- To use TensorBoard locally, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir <OUTPUT_DIR>
    ```

    Then open `http://localhost:6006/` in your browser to view your logs.

- To use TensorBoard in Google Colab run:

    ```bash
    %load_ext tensorboard
    %tensorboard --logdir <OUTPUT_DIR>
    ```

### Logging with Weights and Biases

[Weights and Biases (W&B)](https://www.wandb.ai) is a powerful cloud-based platform that helps you visualize and track training metrics. With W&B set up, you can monitor performance, compare experiments, and optimize model training using its rich feature set. To enable logging, simply pass `wandb=True` when training the model.

<details>
<summary>Using Weights and Biases with RF-DETR</summary>

<br>

- Weights and Biases logging requires additional packages. Install them with:

    ```bash
    pip install "rfdetr[metrics]"
    ```

- Before using W&B, make sure you are logged in:

    ```bash
    wandb login
    ```

    You can retrieve your API key at wandb.ai/authorize.

- To activate logging, pass the extra parameter `wandb=True` to `.train()`:

    ```python
    from rfdetr import RFDETRBase
    
    model = RFDETRBase()
    
    model.train(
        dataset_dir=<DATASET_PATH>,
        epochs=10,
        batch_size=4,
        grad_accum_steps=4,
        lr=1e-4,
        output_dir=<OUTPUT_PATH>,
        wandb=True,
        project=<PROJECT_NAME>,
        run=<RUN_NAME>
    )
    ```

    In W&B, projects are collections of related machine learning experiments, and runs are individual sessions where training or evaluation happens. If you don't specify a name for a run, W&B will assign a random one automatically.

### Load and run fine-tuned model

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRBase

model = RFDETRBase(pretrain_weights=<CHECKPOINT_PATH>)

detections = model.predict(<IMAGE_PATH>)
```

## ONNX export

RF-DETR supports exporting models to the ONNX format, which enables interoperability with various inference frameworks and can improve deployment efficiency.

To export your model, first install the `onnxexport` extension:

```
pip install rfdetr[onnxexport]
```

Then, run:

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRBase

model = RFDETRBase(pretrain_weights=<CHECKPOINT_PATH>)

model.export()
```

This command saves the ONNX model to the `output` directory.
